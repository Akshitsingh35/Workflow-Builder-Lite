Professional Summary

I am a 2025 Computer Engineering graduate from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology with hands-on experience building production-grade backend systems, AI-driven workflows, and blockchain-integrated applications. My work spans full-stack development, distributed systems, LLM-powered automation, and DeFi backend services.

I focus on building modular, extensible systems with strong architectural boundaries, clean APIs, proper validation, and measurable performance improvements. I am particularly interested in AI-native software systems where LLMs are integrated into structured workflows rather than used as isolated API calls.

Work Experience
Full Stack Developer Intern – LogX

June 2025 – September 2025

Architected and engineered an analytics platform for a perpetual futures exchange, enabling monitoring of user portfolios, PnL, liquidations, and market positions across 20+ markets.

Designed and integrated analytics dashboards with backend REST APIs featuring typed, paginated endpoints and Redis-backed caching.

Optimized data-fetch patterns, reducing initial dashboard load time by approximately 60%.

This role strengthened my understanding of performance optimization, caching strategies, financial data modeling, and production REST architecture.

Software Developer Intern (Blockchain) – Antier Solutions

January 2025 – June 2025

Engineered backend services in Node.js to interact with Solidity smart contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721), exposing contract functionality via REST APIs consumed by 50+ test wallets.

Validated and deployed token vesting business logic (cliffs, linear releases, role-based allocations), ensuring accurate on-chain state transitions during staging deployments.

This experience gave me exposure to Web3 backend architecture, contract interaction patterns, and secure state validation across blockchain systems.

Projects
Resume Screening AI System

Python, LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini API, FastAPI, React

Architected a multi-agent resume screening system using LangGraph with 4 specialized AI agents (File Parser, Resume Analyzer, JD Analyzer, Matching Agent).

Implemented a robust fallback mechanism (Gemini → Groq local parsing) with exponential backoff, achieving 99%+ system reliability during API rate limits.

Designed a weighted scoring algorithm (skills 40%, experience 30%, education 15%, technologies 15%) with strict auto-rejection rules for mismatch detection.

This project reflects my interest in agentic AI systems and structured LLM orchestration.

HireReady – AI-Powered Resume Builder

React, Node.js, Express, Gemini API

Built a full-stack resume builder enabling ATS-compliant resumes in under 5 minutes with 4+ templates and PDF export.

Integrated Gemini API to generate optimized summaries, enhance experience descriptions, and recommend relevant skills.

Designed secure REST APIs with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and media upload handling.

ShopStack – Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform

React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Stripe, JWT

Designed backend architecture with JWT-based authentication and RBAC.

Integrated Stripe Checkout with webhook verification.

Implemented MongoDB aggregation pipelines and Redis caching to reduce API response time by approximately 40%.

Current Submission – Workflow Builder Lite

For this assignment, I designed a structured automation runner that:

Supports configurable 2–4 step workflows

Implements a centralized step registry pattern

Distinguishes deterministic steps from LLM-driven steps

Maintains run history with execution timing

Provides system health checks for backend, database, and LLM connectivity

Ensures proper validation and centralized error handling

Rather than hardcoding behavior, I focused on extensibility and clean architecture so new step types can be added without modifying the execution engine.

What I Value

Clean separation of concerns

Predictable system behavior over ad-hoc logic

Performance-aware backend design

Defensive validation at system boundaries

Thoughtful AI integration with fallback and reliability considerations

I use AI development tools to accelerate iteration, but I ensure I understand every architectural decision, API interaction, and abstraction implemented in my systems.
